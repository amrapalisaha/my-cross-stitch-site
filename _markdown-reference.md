# Complete Markdown Primer for Thread Docs

*Your guide to writing beautiful content for your cross-stitch website*

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple way to format text using plain characters. Instead of clicking formatting buttons, you type special symbols that tell the computer how to display your text.

**Think of it like shorthand for formatting:**
- `**bold**` instead of clicking a Bold button
- `# Heading` instead of selecting "Heading 1" from a menu

---

## Headers & Titles

Use `#` symbols to create headings. More `#` = smaller heading.

```markdown
# Main Title (Biggest)
## Section Heading  
### Subsection
#### Small Heading
##### Smaller Heading
###### Smallest Heading
```

**For your cross-stitch site:**
```markdown
# Wedding Sampler for Sarah & Mike
## Project Details
### Stitching Techniques Used
#### French Knots
```

---

## Text Formatting

### Basic Emphasis
```markdown
*italic text* or _italic text_
**bold text** or __bold text__
***bold and italic*** or ___bold and italic___
~~strikethrough text~~
```

**Results:**
- *italic text*
- **bold text** 
- ***bold and italic***
- ~~strikethrough text~~

### Perfect for Cross-Stitch Content
```markdown
I'm working on a **gorgeous wedding sampler** with *delicate roses* and ***absolutely stunning*** gold metallic threads.

~~I thought this would take 2 weeks~~ This actually took 6 weeks, but it was worth every stitch!
```

```

**Results:**

## Code and Technical Text

### Inline Code
Use backticks for technical terms or pattern references:

```markdown
Use `DMC 817` for the rose centers and `DMC 3689` for highlights.
The pattern calls for a `French knot` in each flower center.
```

### Code Blocks
For longer technical content:

```markdown
```
Pattern Instructions:
1. Start 2 inches from top edge
2. Count 47 stitches from left edge  
3. Begin with symbol ‚òÖ in center
```
```

---

## Horizontal Lines

Create visual breaks in your content:

```markdown
---
```

**Perfect for separating project sections:**
```markdown
## Current Projects
Working on three pieces this month...

---

## Recently Completed  
Just finished these beautiful pieces...

---

## Planning Phase
Excited to start these patterns next...
```

## Markdown for Different Content Types

### Project Documentation
```markdown
# Rose Garden Wedding Sampler

![Completed sampler](images/rose-wedding-final.jpg)

## Project Overview
**Recipients:** Sarah & Michael Thompson  
**Occasion:** Wedding gift  
**Started:** January 15, 2024  
**Completed:** March 20, 2024  
**Fabric:** 18-count ivory Aida  
**Finished size:** 12" x 16"  

## Design Elements
The sampler features:
- **Central motif:** Intertwined wedding rings
- **Border pattern:** Climbing roses with thorns
- **Personalization:** Names and wedding date
- **Color palette:** Soft pinks, sage greens, and gold metallic

::: {.callout-note}
## Special Technique
I used a combination of cross-stitch and backstitch for the rose petals, with French knots for dimensional centers.
:::

## Challenges & Solutions
The trickiest part was getting the metallic thread to lie flat. I discovered that using shorter lengths (about 12 inches) and gentle tension made all the difference.

**Time breakdown:**
- Design planning: 5 hours
- Stitching: 85 hours  
- Finishing: 8 hours
- **Total:** 98 hours of love ‚ù§Ô∏è

# Mastering French Knots: My Journey from Frustration to Love

*Posted: March 15, 2024* üìÖ

For the longest time, French knots were my nemesis. They'd either be too loose, too tight, or mysteriously disappear into the fabric. But after working on my latest rose sampler, I finally cracked the code! üéâ

## The Breakthrough Moment ‚ú®

It happened while working on the centers of tiny roses for a wedding gift. I was getting frustrated with my usual approach when I tried something different...

### What I Used to Do ‚ùå
- Wrap the thread 3-4 times around the needle
- Pull tight immediately  
- Wonder why it looked messy

### What Works Better ‚úÖ
- **Two wraps only** - more wraps = bigger knots, not better knots
- **Gentle tension** - snug but not strangling the thread
- **Needle angle** - keep it close to perpendicular to fabric
- **Confidence** - pull through decisively, don't hesitate

::: {.callout-tip}
## My Secret Weapon
I use a slightly larger needle (size 22 instead of 24) for French knots. The larger eye makes it easier to pull the wrapped thread through cleanly.
:::

## Practice Makes Perfect üéØ

I spent an evening just practicing French knots on scrap Aida:
- Started with **heavy thread** (easier to see what's happening)
- Used **high contrast** colors (dark thread on light fabric)
- Made **rows of knots** to get into a rhythm

## The Results Speak for Themselves üì∏

![Before and after French knots comparison](images/french-knots-comparison.jpg)
*Left: My old struggling attempts. Right: New technique results!*

Now I actually **look forward** to patterns with French knots. Who would have thought? üòÑ

What techniques have you struggled with that suddenly "clicked"? I'd love to hear your breakthrough stories! üí¨

## Pro Tips for Thread Docs

### 1. Use Descriptive Alt Text
```markdown
![Wedding sampler showing intertwined rings surrounded by pink roses](images/wedding-rings-sampler.jpg)
```
This helps with accessibility and SEO.

### 2. Consistent Image Naming
```markdown
images/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-wedding-sampler-final.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-wedding-sampler-wip1.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-wedding-sampler-detail.jpg
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ technique-french-knots-demo.jpg
```

### 3. Mix Text and Visuals
Don't just show photos - tell the story:
```markdown
![Close-up of rose detail](images/rose-closeup.jpg)

Each rose took about 45 minutes to complete. The petals are worked in long-and-short stitch using three shades of pink (**DMC 3706**, **3708**, and **3716**), while the centers feature dimensional French knots in golden yellow (**DMC 744**).
```

### 4. Use Markdown Comments
Add notes that won't show up on the website:
```markdown
<!-- TODO: Add more photos of the framing process -->
<!-- Remember to update this when the piece is gifted -->
```

### 5. Link Between Related Content
```markdown
This technique builds on the [basic cross-stitch foundation](basics.qmd#foundation-stitches) covered earlier.
