It helps me see how far Iâ€™ve come!\n\n\nWhat to Expect\nProject Updates: Regular posts about my current works in progress, including photos and reflections on what Iâ€™m learning.\nTechnique Tips: When I figure out a tricky technique or find a helpful method, Iâ€™ll share it here.\nPattern Reviews: Honest thoughts about patterns Iâ€™ve worked, including difficulty level and any modifications I made.\nSupply Reviews: My thoughts on different fabrics, threads, and tools as I try them."
