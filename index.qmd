Welcome to **Thread Docs**! This is where my *technical writing chops* meet my *cross-stitch artistry*.

I have been working as a technical writer for as long as I have been cross-stitching. This website is a testament to a process I deeply enjoy and is common to both technical writing and cross-stitch, taking something seemingly complex and transforming it into something beautiful.
